# To populate all changes in this file you need to regenerate your
# grub configuration file afterwards:
#     'grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg'
#
# See the grub info page for documentation on possible variables and
# their associated values.

# GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX explanation:
# Into crypt_root write your encrypted device location.
# Into real_root write your root location. E.g.: /dev/mapper/gentoo-root
# Into resume write your swap partition location. E.g.: /dev/mapper/gentoo-swap
# Notice that you can use UUIDs instead of "raw" locations.
# This can be got using the blkid utilitiy.
#
# GRUB_BACKGROUND explanation:
# If you want to use an image as background of your GRUB screen, uncomment GRUB_BACKGROUND
# and add the path where is your wished image. For example, I usually make a directory into:
# /boot/grub/ called backgrounds (/boot/grub/backgrounds/) and I put my image there.
#
# GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR explanation:
# Sure you would like to change this value :-)
#
# GRUB_GFXMODE explanation:
# That's my computer screen resolution. If you don't have that resolution, only adapt this
# value either to your computer screen resolution or your wished screen resolution.
